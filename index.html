  <h1>Are lefties better at Baseball?</h1>

    <h2>Handedness of Baseball Players</h2>
    <p>Around 10% of the world population is left-handed [1], however we
    see a much higher proportion of left-handed inviduals playing baseball.
    From a sample of 891 baseball players, we see that around 60% are right handed,
    almost 30% are left handed and 10% are ambidextrous. Do left-handed
    players perform better at this sport?</p>

    <h2>Batting Average by Handedness</h2>
    <p>The batting average is a baseball statistic which is defined by the number
      of hits divided by at bats [2]. The median batting average
      of left-handed players is higher than right-handed and ambidextrous players.
      <br>
      Left-handed players have less variability in their batting average. However,
      the two highest performers are left-handed.

    <h2>Home Runs by Handedness</h2>
    <p>In Baseball an home run is when a batter hits the ball over the edge of
      the field and then is able to score a point by reaching home safely. A less
      common type of home run is called a <em>inside-the-par home run</em>. This
      is when the batter is able to circle all the bases without being  put out by
      the fielders of the opposite team. [3]
      <br>
      Left-handed players have a median number of home runs
      higher than the other players.

    <h2>What's in the Handedness?</h2>
    Are left-handed people more athletic? Why do they tend to perform better in
    baseball and why are they present in higher proportion than in the general
    population? The short answer: baseball is built for lefties [4].

    <blockquote cite="http://www.livescience.com/2665-baseball-rigged-lefties.html">
<b>The ballparks:</b> Right field in most parks is shorter than left field
because of the preponderance of right-handed hitters.
<br>

<b>Seeing the ball:</b> "A right-handed batter facing a right-handed pitcher actually
has to pick up the ball visually as it comes from behind his (the batter's) left
shoulder. The left-handed batter facing the right-handed pitcher has the ball
coming to him, so he has a much clearer view of pitches."
<br>
<b>Getting going:</b> After a right-hander connects with a ball, his momentum spins him
toward the third-base side. He must regroup to take even his first step toward
first base. A left-hander's momentum carries him directly toward first. "The
left-handed batter has a 5-foot advantage over the right-handed batter," Peters
calculates. "And that means the lefty travels the 90 feet to first roughly
one-sixth of a second faster than the righty. That translates to more base hits
for the left-hander, whether singles or extra base hits because lefties are
getting to the bases more quickly."
